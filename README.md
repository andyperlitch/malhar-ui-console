DataTorrent Console
===================

Open-source, web-based user interface for use with [DataTorrent](http://datatorrent.com), a stream-processing platform for developing real-time, big data applications in Hadoop.
Built with Angular.

For a more thorough overview, [see the wiki](https://github.com/DataTorrent/malhar-ui-console/wiki).

Building
--------
### Note regarding npm version

Due to a race condition bug in older npm versions, it is recommended that your npm version is at least v2.1.1. To update, run:

    sudo npm -g i npm@2.1.1

Check out npm issues [#6309](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6309) and [#6318](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6318) for more details.

### Running the build
To build this project, run the following commands:

    npm install . --no-optional
    bower install
    gulp

This will create a `dist` folder that will contain the appropriate files to be served by the DataTorrent Gateway (Gateway serves files from the location specified by the `dt.gateway.staticResourceDirectory` property in your dt-site.xml. Defaults to `/home/[USER]/htdocs`).


Setting up dev environment
--------------------------
### Install current dependencies
Uses the `bower.json` and `package.json` files:

    npm install .
    bower install .

### Use gulp tasks

* `gulp serve` to launch a browser sync server (default=localhost:9000) on the source files
 * To run the server on a different port, run `PORT=19000 gulp serve`
 * If your gateway is running on a port other than 3390, override it like so: `GATEWAY_PORT=9090 gulp serve`
 * Note that you can combine the two overrides above. For example: `GATEWAY_PORT=9090 PORT=19000 gulp serve`
 * To prevent a browser window from opening, pass the `--dont-open` flag to this command, e.g. `gulp serve --dont-open`
* `gulp` or `gulp build` to build an optimized version of the application in `/dist`
* `gulp serve:dist` to launch a server on the optimized application
* `gulp test` to launch unit tests with Karma
* `gulp testall` to launch unit tests with Karma on all available browsers (requires optional dependencies)

Testing
----------

### One-time Run
To run the tests once, run `gulp test`.

### Continuously
To run the tests continuously, listening for changes to test files, run `gulp karma:watch`.

### Coverage
To generate a coverage report, run `gulp coverage`.

### End-to-End

**NOTE: this is a work-in-progress.**

1. To run end-2-end tests using protractor and selenium, you will first need to ensure that protractor and webdriver-manager are installed and up to date: 
    ```
    sudo npm install -g protractor
    sudo webdriver-manager update
    ```

2. Start the selenium server
    ```
    webdriver-manager start
    ```

3. Run the tests with protractor
    ```
    protractor test/protractor.conf.js
    ```


Working with Dependencies
-------------------------
### Installing a bower package
To use a package from bower, first run the bower install command:

    bower install PACKAGE_NAME[#VERSION_TAG] [--save]

Then, use `gulp bower` to automatically inject this package into index.html:

### Updating packages

    bower update [PACKAGE_NAME]
    gulp bower

### Uninstalling a package

    bower uninstall [PACKAGE_NAME] --save
    gulp bower


App components & sections
-------------------------
The files in this project are organized into feature/component directories, rather than `controllers`, `directives`, `services` folders, etc. Components that are used in multiple locations of the dashboard should be placed in the `app/components` directory. Specific page code (e.g. templates and controllers for specific pages) should be placed in the `app/pages` folder, or one of its subfolders. For more info on this type of organization, read [Best Practice Recommendations for Angular App Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub).

### Updating `index.html` with app scripts
The following command walks the `app` directory and updates `app/index.html` with all the `.js` files:
    
    gulp appscripts

This script excludes files that end in `_test.js` and all `js` files inside of `bower_components`.

Stylesheets
-----------
This project uses the [LESS CSS pre-processor](http://lesscss.org/) to organize its styling. A "manifest" file is located at `app/styles/main.less`, which @imports all style dependencies (eg. from a bower component) and custom DataTorrent UI component styles (eg. `/app/styles/navbar.less`).

### Variables & Mixins
Whenever possible, custom DataTorrent UI component styles should use variables and mixins from the Twitter Bootstrap library. This makes theming/skinning as easy as overriding these variables. When additional variables are required specifically for DataTorrent UI components, they should be declared in `/app/styles/main.less` with appropriate defaults.

### Themes
A "theme" is really just a file that overrides Twitter Bootstrap and other DataTorrent-UI-specific variables (defined in `/app/styles/main.less`). To create a new theme, create a `.less` file inside `/app/styles/themes/` directory, then run:

    grunt serve --theme=[YOUR_THEME_FILENAME_NO_EXTENSION]

### Theme Overrides
On rare occasion, it is useful to have a final theme-agnostic file to place important overrides. These should be placed into `/app/styles/theme-overrides.less`. The only use-case for this as of this writing is to override the path to Twitter Bootstrap fonts (`@icon-font-path`) from the theme file, which often has the default value set.
